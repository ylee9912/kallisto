0. Navigate to home directory: *cd ~*
1. Install automake and autoreconf by the following commands: *sudo apt install automake* and
*sudo apt install autoreconf*
2. From https://cmake.org/download/, install cmake : *wget cmake-3.15.0-rc4-Linux-x86_64.sh*
Then, perform the command  *bash cmake-3.15.0-rc4-Linux-x86_64.sh* which will run the script that installs cmake, allowing us to compile the kallisto code.

6. Navigate into the kallisto folder: *cd kallisto*
7. Now,  autoreconfigure in the htslib directory:  *autoreconf ext/htslib/*
8. Create a new folder called build: *mkdir build*
